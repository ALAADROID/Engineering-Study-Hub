# Final Exam Topics – Quick Review Notes

## Chapter Mapping (What Comes From Where)

* **Chapter 1 – Introduction and Data Collection**

  * Definitions only (data, variables, population, sample)
  * Very light theory

* **Chapter 2 – Presenting Data in Tables and Charts**

  * Reading tables & charts
  * No heavy calculations

* **Chapter 3 – Numerical Descriptive Measures**

  * Mean, variance, standard deviation (conceptual)
  * Knowing what each measure represents

* **Chapter 4 – Basic Probability**

  * Probability rules
  * Bayes’ Theorem ⭐

* **Chapter 5 – Some Important Discrete Probability Distributions**

  * Random variables (discrete)
  * Finding P(X = x)
  * Recognizing distributions

* **Chapter 6 – The Normal Distribution and Other Continuous Distributions** ⭐⭐⭐

  * Normal distribution
  * Z-scores
  * Section 6.2 (ALL question types)

* **Chapter 7 – Beginning only**

  * Intro to continuous distributions
  * Conceptual understanding (very light math)

## Core Exam Topics (As Stated by the Professor)

### 1. Random Variables

* A variable determined by chance
* Discrete vs Continuous

---

### 2. Probability of Finding X Values

**Discrete:**

```
P(X = x)
```

**Continuous:**

```
P(a < X < b)
P(X = x) = 0
```

---

### 3. Bayes’ Theorem (بايز ثيورم)

```
P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A) / P(B)
```

Where:

```
P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|Aᶜ)P(Aᶜ)
```

Used when probability is reversed.

---

### 4. Normal Distribution (VERY IMPORTANT)

* Mean = μ
* Standard deviation = σ

**Standardization:**

```
Z = (X − μ) / σ
```

Rules:

* Left tail → table value
* Right tail → `1 − table`
* Between → subtraction
* Symmetric → ±Z

---

### 5. Section 6.2 – MAXIMUM IMPORTANCE

You must know how to:

* Find probabilities between two Z values
* Find upper & lower tail probabilities
* Find Z given area
* Use symmetry

**Key values:**

```
68.26% → Z = ±1
95% → Z = ±1.96
99.7% → Z = ±3
```

---

### 6. Chapter 7 (Beginning)

* Uniform distribution (concept)
* PDF & CDF meaning
* No deep calculations

---

## Final Exam Focus Order

1. Normal distribution (Chapter 6)
2. Section 6.2 questions
3. Bayes’ theorem (Chapter 4)
4. Random variables & probability rules
5. Light theory from other chapters
