## Chapter 1: Introduction and Data Collection

### What is Statistics?
Statistics is the branch of mathematics that:
- Collects, processes, and analyzes data
- Transforms numbers into useful information
- Reduces uncertainty in decision making

---

### Types of Statistics
**Descriptive Statistics**
- Collecting, summarizing, and describing data
- Tables, graphs, averages

**Inferential Statistics**
- Drawing conclusions about a population using a sample
- Estimation and hypothesis testing

---

### Basic Definitions (VERY IMPORTANT)
- **Population**: The entire set of items or individuals of interest
- **Sample**: A subset of the population used for analysis
- **Variable**: A characteristic of an item or individual
- **Data**: The values associated with a variable
- **Parameter**: A numerical measure describing a population
- **Statistic**: A numerical measure describing a sample

---

### Sources of Data
- **Primary Data**: Collected by the analyst (surveys, experiments)
- **Secondary Data**: Collected by others (census, journals, internet)

---

### Types of Variables
- **Categorical (Qualitative)**: Categories only (yes/no, eye color)
- **Numerical (Quantitative)**:
  - **Discrete**: Counted values (number of children)
  - **Continuous**: Measured values (weight, time)

---

### Levels of Measurement
- **Nominal**: Categories, no order (eye color)
- **Ordinal**: Ordered categories (grades, rankings)
- **Interval**: Ordered, no true zero (temperature in °C)
- **Ratio**: Ordered, true zero (weight, height)

---

## Chapter 2: Presenting Data in Tables and Charts

### Categorical Data
Used tools:
- Summary Table
- Bar Chart
- Pie Chart
- Pareto Diagram (descending order + cumulative %)

---

### Numerical Data
Used tools:
- Ordered Array
- Stem-and-Leaf Display
- Frequency Distribution
- Histogram
- Frequency Polygon
- Ogive (Cumulative %)
- Scatter Plot
- Time Series Plot

---

### Frequency Distribution (VERY IMPORTANT)

Steps:
1. Sort data
2. Find range = max − min
3. Choose number of classes (5–15)
4. Class width = range ÷ number of classes (round up)
5. Define class limits
6. Count frequencies
7. Compute:
   - Relative frequency
   - Percentage
   - Cumulative frequency

---

### Key Formulas
- **Class Width** = (Highest − Lowest) ÷ Number of Classes
- **Relative Frequency** = Class Frequency ÷ Total Frequency
- **Percentage** = Relative Frequency × 100

---

### Histogram
- Vertical bar chart from a frequency distribution
- No gaps between bars
- X-axis: class boundaries or midpoints
- Y-axis: frequency / relative frequency / percentage

---

### Comparing Groups
- If sample sizes differ → use **relative frequency or percentage**
- Not raw frequency

---

### Graphing Rules (Exam Traps)
- Vertical axis starts at zero
- No chart junk
- Proper labels and titles
- Do not distort scale

---

### Cross Tabulation
- Used for two categorical variables
- Presented as:
  - Contingency table
  - Side-by-side bar chart

---

### Scatter Plot
- Two numerical variables
- Shows relationship (not causation)

---

### Time Series Plot
- Numerical variable vs time
- Used to detect trends
