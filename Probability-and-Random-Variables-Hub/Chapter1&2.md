## Chapter 1: Introduction and Data Collection
(**Only definitions — as studied**)

### Population
The **population** is the entire set of all items or individuals of interest.

### Sample
A **sample** is a portion of the population selected for analysis.

### Variable
A **variable** is a characteristic of an item or an individual.

### Data
**Data** are the different values associated with a variable.

> These four definitions are enough for Chapter 1.

## Chapter 2: Presenting Data in Tables and Charts
(**Focus: Frequency Distribution**)

### Frequency Distribution
A **frequency distribution** is a summary table in which data are arranged into **numerically ordered classes**.

It contains:
- Class intervals
- Frequency
- Cumulative frequency
- Relative frequency
- Percentage
- Cumulative percentage
- Class boundaries

---

## Steps to Construct a Frequency Distribution

1. **Sort data** in ascending order  
2. **Find the range**  
   Range = Maximum - Minimum
3. **Select number of classes** (usually between 5 and 15)  
4. **Compute class width**  
   Class Width = Range / Number of Classes "round up if needed"
5. **Determine class limits and boundaries**
6. **Count frequencies**
7. **Compute relative frequency, percentage, and cumulative values**

## Example — Frequency Distribution Table

Data (daily temperatures):
12, 13, 17, 21, 24, 24, 26, 27, 27, 30,
32, 35, 37, 38, 41, 43, 44, 46, 53, 58

- Total (N) = 20  
- Minimum = 12  
- Maximum = 58  
- Range = 46  
- Number of classes = 5  
- Class width = 46 ÷ 5 ≈ 9.2 → **10**

### Frequency Distribution Table

| Class Interval | Frequency (f) | Cumulative Frequency (CF) | Relative Frequency (f/N) | Percentage | Cumulative Percentage | Class Boundaries |
|----------------|---------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|------------|------------------------|------------------|
| 10–19 | 3 | 3 | 0.15 | 15% | 15% | 9.5–19.5 |
| 20–29 | 6 | 9 | 0.30 | 30% | 45% | 19.5–29.5 |
| 30–39 | 5 | 14 | 0.25 | 25% | 70% | 29.5–39.5 |
| 40–49 | 4 | 18 | 0.20 | 20% | 90% | 39.5–49.5 |
| 50–59 | 2 | 20 | 0.10 | 10% | 100% | 49.5–59.5 |

## Histogram
A **histogram** is a **vertical bar chart** constructed from a frequency distribution.

- No gaps between bars
- X-axis: class intervals
- Y-axis: frequency / percentage

---

## Chapter 2 — What You Need to Remember
- Frequency distribution structure
- Class width formula
- Difference between frequency, relative frequency, and percentage
- Cumulative frequency and cumulative percentage
- Histogram definition

> This is sufficient for Chapter 2.
