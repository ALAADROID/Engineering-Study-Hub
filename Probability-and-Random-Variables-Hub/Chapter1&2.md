# Exam Review – Chapter 1 & Chapter 2
(Based ONLY on professor topics & likely exam style)

## Chapter 1 – Introduction and Data Collection
(LOW weight – definitions only)

### Typical exam questions
- “Define population / sample”
- “Is this a parameter or a statistic?”
- “Is this variable categorical or numerical?”

### Example 1 – Population vs Sample
A study wants to analyze **all students in a university**.
- Population: all university students
- Sample: 200 students selected for the study
- Sample mean → statistic
- True mean of all students → parameter

---

### Example 2 – Variable & Data
Variable: **Exam score**  
Data: 72, 85, 90, 66, 78

---

### Example 3 – Type of Variable
- Number of children → **Numerical, Discrete**
- Weight → **Numerical, Continuous**
- Marital status → **Categorical**

⚠️ Chapter 1 stops here for the exam.

---

## Chapter 2 – Presenting Data in Tables and Charts
(IMPORTANT because it leads to later chapters)

---

## 1️⃣ Frequency Distribution (VERY IMPORTANT)

### What the exam really tests
- Can you **build** the table?
- Can you **compare groups** using **relative frequency / percentage**?
- Can you **interpret** the table?

---

### Example 1 – Constructing a Frequency Distribution

Data (daily temperatures):
24, 35, 17, 21, 24, 37, 26, 46, 58, 30,
32, 13, 12, 38, 41, 43, 44, 27, 53, 27


#### Step 1: Sort data
12, 13, 17, 21, 24, 24, 26, 27, 27, 30,
32, 35, 37, 38, 41, 43, 44, 46, 53, 58


#### Step 2: Range
58 − 12 = 46


#### Step 3: Number of classes
Choose 5 (allowed: 5–15)


#### Step 4: Class width
46 ÷ 5 = 9.2 → round up → 10


#### Step 5: Classes
| Class Interval | Frequency | Relative Freq | % |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10–<20 | 3 | 0.15 | 15 |
| 20–<30 | 6 | 0.30 | 30 |
| 30–<40 | 5 | 0.25 | 25 |
| 40–<50 | 4 | 0.20 | 20 |
| 50–<60 | 2 | 0.10 | 10 |
| **Total** | 20 | **1.00** | **100** |

✔ This table is **EXAM LEVEL**

---

## 2️⃣ Relative Frequency & Percentage (VERY IMPORTANT)

### WHY?
Because the exam LOVES comparing **two groups with different sizes**.

---

### Example 2 – Comparing Two Groups (LIKE TABLE 2.10)

| Cost ($) | City (Rel.) | City (%) | Suburban (Rel.) | Suburban (%) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 20–<30 | 0.12 | 12 | 0.10 | 10 |
| 30–<40 | 0.14 | 14 | 0.34 | 34 |
| 40–<50 | 0.38 | 38 | 0.34 | 34 |
| 50–<60 | 0.18 | 18 | 0.14 | 14 |
| 60–<70 | 0.12 | 12 | 0.08 | 8 |
| 70–<80 | 0.06 | 6 | 0.00 | 0 |
| **Total** | **1.00** | **100** | **1.00** | **100** |

### Typical exam questions
- “Which group spends more in the 30–40 range?”
- “Why not compare raw frequencies?”
✅ Because **sample sizes differ**

---

## 3️⃣ Cumulative Frequency (Medium importance)

### Example question
> What percentage of days had temperatures **below 40°C**?

Answer:
15% + 30% + 25% = 70%

yaml
Copy code

---

## 4️⃣ Histogram (Linked to Frequency Distribution)

### Exam reality
- You will **NOT** be asked to draw it
- You WILL be asked to **interpret it**

### Key idea
- Histogram = graphical form of frequency distribution
- NO gaps
- X-axis = class intervals
- Y-axis = frequency / %

---

## ❌ Low Priority / SKIP for exam
(Unless interpretation only)

- Pie charts
- Pareto diagrams
- Scatter plots
- Time series plots
- Cross tabulations

⚠️ Know **what they are**, not how to build them.

---

## Final Exam Strategy for Chapters 1 & 2

### MUST MASTER
- Definitions (Chapter 1)
- Frequency distribution steps
- Class width formula
- Relative frequency vs percentage
- Comparing two groups

### SAFE TO SKIM
- Fancy graph rules
- Software talk
- Chart aesthetics

---

## Key Formula (MEMORIZE)
Class Width = (Max − Min) ÷ Number of Classes

yaml
Copy code

Say **“Chapter 3”**  
(or if you want: **“Give me exam-style questions for Ch 2”**)
