# Chapter 6:

____

## The Normal Distribution
- μ (Mean) = Median = Mode : location
- σ (standard deviation): spread  

---

## Standardized Normal Distribution (Z)
- Mean = 0
- Standard deviation = 1

---

## Z-Score Formula
[ Z = (X - μ) / σ ]
- Total area = 1  (Half above μ and half below μ )

---

## General Steps to Solve Normal Probability Problems
1. Draw the normal curve  
2. Convert X to Z using the formula  
3. Use the Z-table  

### 1. Lower Tail
P(X < a)  

### 2. Upper Tail
P(X > a) = 1 - P(Z ≤ a)  

### 3. Between Two Values
P(a < X < b) = P(Z < b) - P(Z < a)

## Finding X from a Given Probability
Used for:
- fastest %
- slowest %
- cutoff values

## Important Z Values to Memorize

| Description | Z |
|------------|---|
| Middle 90% | ±1.645 |
| Middle 95% | ±1.96 |
| Middle 99% | ±2.576 |
| Fastest 10% | −1.28 |
| Slowest 10% | +1.28 |

## Symmetric Questions
If the problem says:
> "symmetrically around the mean"

Then:
- Use ±Z
- Convert both limits to X
